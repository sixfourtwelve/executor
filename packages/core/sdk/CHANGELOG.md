### Patch Changes

- [#1498](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1498) [`657b913`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/657b9135b8b841495b362936bf60bdca998c16eb) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Add anonymous product analytics to the local daemon (CLI + desktop) and self-host: execution counts split by MCP/API plane, toolkit usage, integration add/remove, and artifact usage (created/viewed/updated/deleted, attributed to agent tools vs the console UI), filed under a persisted per-install anonymous id. Opt out with DO_NOT_TRACK or EXECUTOR_DISABLE_ANALYTICS.

### Patch Changes

- [#1443](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1443) [`1b9b1f1`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/1b9b1f10313834a625a411169ebf83f6181589df) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Re-register a dynamically registered OAuth client when the configured callback URL changes instead of reusing the stale registration. DCR clients now persist the redirect URI they registered with the authorization server (`oauth_client.origin_redirect_uri`), and the per-issuer reuse lookup compares it against the current flow callback — a mismatch (for example after a sandbox recreation moved the callback origin) mints a fresh client rather than pairing the old registration with the new callback, which strict providers reject with `invalid_redirect_uri`. The stale client row is left in place so existing connections keep refreshing through it; clients persisted before this release have no stored redirect URI and continue to be reused as before.

### Patch Changes

- [#1422](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1422) [`e2712db`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/e2712dbff98145c5c340832ffbdcb21113b9dd78) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - A token refresh the authorization server definitively rejects (any RFC 6749 error code, not just `invalid_grant`) now surfaces to the sandbox as an `oauth_refresh_failed` auth failure carrying the server's error code and description, instead of being scrubbed to "Internal tool error". `invalid_grant` still classifies as `oauth_reauth_required`. Code-less failures (transport blips) keep retrying as before.

- [#1427](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1427) [`7207347`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/720734756a70b1b4f1564bdf82dc4118e5de2b76) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Apply persisted RFC 6902 overrides to OpenAPI specifications during preview, import, and refresh so upstream documents can be corrected without maintaining a fork. Figma imports automatically narrow OAuth to the scopes supported by its OAuth app configuration.

- [#1425](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1425) [`0c4e9b4`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/0c4e9b49fecb35ad71c92a464c3ea01131ff9d6f) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Preserve an integration's declared OAuth scopes when same-origin authorization-server metadata describes a different authorization or token endpoint.

### Patch Changes

- [#1246](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1246) [`1c48182`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/1c4818254e71dc4ee27ff95f489e2c5cf330a450) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Keep MCP tool catalogs in sync with the server's live tool set. Previously a
  connection's tools were listed once at create time and never updated unless the
  integration's config changed or a user clicked Refresh, so server-side tool
  changes silently broke invocations.
  - `tools/list` discovery now follows `nextCursor` pagination per the MCP spec,
    so servers with paginated catalogs list completely instead of first-page-only.
  - The client handles `notifications/tools/list_changed` received during a tool
    call and marks the connection's persisted catalog stale; the next tools read
    re-lists from the server.
  - An unknown-tool rejection from the server (protocol error or the reference
    SDK's error envelope) returns a typed `mcp_tool_unknown` failure telling the
    caller to re-list, and marks the catalog stale so it heals on the next read.
  - Remote catalogs now also refresh on read once older than a freshness TTL
    (`ExecutorConfig.toolsSyncTtlMs`, default 15 minutes, `null` to disable),
    covering servers that change tools without notifying.
  - A failed listing (server unreachable, auth not ready) no longer wipes the
    previously persisted catalog; it is kept and retried after the TTL.

### Patch Changes

- [#964](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/964) [`7cee242`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/7cee242f07687b0d8711201c620d8c61594adc15) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Faster integrations with large API specs**

  Resolved OpenAPI spec text and GraphQL introspection snapshots are now stored content-addressed in the plugin blob store instead of inline in each integration's stored config. Listing integrations no longer loads multi-megabyte spec blobs it immediately discards, which makes the integrations surface dramatically faster for workspaces with large specs. Existing integrations keep working: rows that still inline a spec resolve unchanged and are rewritten in place the next time they are imported or refreshed.

Versions 1.5.5 and 1.5.6 of the library packages were published directly to npm to fix installs resolving the wrong `fumadb` dependency (the vendored database layer is now scoped as `@executor-js/fumadb`); that fix landed in the repo separately, and this release brings the recorded package versions back in line with npm.

- [#922](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/922) [`1ba0193`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/1ba01932919e6aee25a76c4c093841df8539adad) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Move `effect` from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` in the published library packages so consumers provide a single shared Effect instance.
